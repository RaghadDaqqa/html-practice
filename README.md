A welcome page with basic HTML structure including `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<a>` tags.

### `about.html`  
A personal introduction page using headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`) to describe myself and my goals.

### 'day3.html'
Includes Day 3: practicing HTML links and images to build connected and visual web pages.
