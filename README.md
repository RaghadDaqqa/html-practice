# HTML Practice – Raghad

This repository contains my first HTML practice files. Each file represents a daily step in my journey to become a professional web developer.

## Files

### `index.html`  
A welcome page with basic HTML structure including `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<a>` tags.

### `about.html`  
A personal introduction page using headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`) to describe myself and my goals.

### `day3.html`  
A web page that includes an internal link to the about.html file using the <a> tag, and an embedded image using the <img> tag. This file demonstrates how to connect pages and add visual content, focusing on the use of href, src, and alt attributes.
